# Movie Review Tracker

Welcome to **Movie Review Tracker**, a sleek, dark-themed web application designed to help movie enthusiasts fetch movie details, log personal reviews, and manage them in a downloadable CSV file. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a touch of PHP, this tool combines a modern Material Design aesthetic with practical functionality.

## Features

- **Fetch Movie Data**: Enter an IMDb ID (e.g., `tt1375666` for *Inception*) to instantly pull movie details like title, year, genre, country, language, runtime, and poster from the OMDB API.
- **Add Reviews**: Rate movies (0-100), write reviews, and record watch dates, all stored locally and synced to a CSV file.
- **Interactive Display**: View your reviews in collapsible cards with country flags, color-coded ratings, and edit/delete options.
- **Downloadable CSV**: Export your reviews as a `movie_reviews.csv` file for backups or external use.
- **Dark Theme**: A stylish, eye-friendly Material Design interface with smooth animations and responsive layout.
